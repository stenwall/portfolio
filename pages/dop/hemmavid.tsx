              Hemmavid is a documentary poem about three women in a small
              village, Vormsele, in the interior of VÃ¤sterbotten. We meet
              Isabelle, who has returned home after a personal trauma, Rut who
              has lived in the village all her life and Katharina - a German
              woman who together with her British husband drove through the
              village 8 years ago, and has stayed there ever since.
            </p>
            <p>
              Hemmavid is about these people's relationship to a home, and a
              place.
